    "# **Optimization of phase controller for driving a car using a genetic algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this work was to optimize the phase controller for driving using a genetic algorithm. The controller operated a car that was moving on an open or closed road, depending on the given options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper first shows that it is possible to construct a phase controller that will properly control the car, and then it is shown that it is possible to optimize the functions of input and output, based on given rules using a genetic algorithm, so that it manages the car properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of the genetic algorithm was measured by comparing the optimized system with a man-made system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The car is driven correctly if the car does not collide with the edges of the road and if it moves in the middle of the road, as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The car was tested on two types of roads. The first type of path is a curved path generated by a sine wave, and the second type of road was a closed circular path generated by a convex envelope of a randomly selected set of coordinates.\n",

    "Since each individual crosses a similar trajectory, some positions are counted multiple times. Calculating the distance is an expensive operation. We do not make a big mistake if we round the position of the vehicle and the angle of rotation of the vehicle to an integer. In that case, we have the final number of states in which the vehicle can come. In the map we can store the key that represents the arranged triplet **(Xo, Yo, a)**, ie the position of the vehicle and the angle. This key is mapped to the ordered triple **(left_sensor_input, front_sensor_input, right_sensor_input)**. With this optimization, we eliminate *double* calculations. The consequence is the slow initialization of the population and the slow counting of the first few generations."

    "> Combinatorial explosion. As a rule, we have *n + 1* possibilities for each input argument (we do not have to use a whole as an argument) and we have *n* possibilities for each output whole. We have 625 possibilities for the angle and 500 possibilities for the speed. That's a total of 312,500 rule options. Together with the input and output units, this number is huge, and the evaluation of the solution is an expensive operation. It is practically impossible to do that in our case if we take into account that the execution time of the program should be relatively short.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to optimize the phase controller for car control with the help of a genetic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been shown that with a sufficient number of iterations, the car can achieve relatively correct movement on the road. In this case, the only obstacles are the ends of the roads, but the assumption is that the phase system can be used to avoid simpler obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it has been shown that in some cases it is possible to use controllers that are trained on a winding road for driving on a closed road, and it has been shown that the opposite can be true.\n",
    "The success of this use of the controller depended mostly on the closed road on which the vehicle was trained, since it was randomly generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Further development**\n",
    "\n",
    "Further development can go in the direction of time optimization of the algorithm, with special emphasis on the function that calculates fitness. It is also possible to test and train the algorithm on different path configurations than those presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase system could be translated to an Arduino chip to drive the actual vehicle."
